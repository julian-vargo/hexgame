Hexgame is a board game inspired by Settlers of Catan. It offers an exciting strategic experience where players compete to build and expand their settlements in a hexagonal world.

## Gameplay

The objective of Hexgame is to accumulate victory points by building settlements, cities, and roads. The game takes place on a hexagonal game board comprising various terrain types, each producing different resources.

Similar to Settlers of Catan, players take turns rolling dice to determine which terrain hexes generate resources. Players can trade resources with each other, strategically negotiate, and plan their moves to gain an advantage.
